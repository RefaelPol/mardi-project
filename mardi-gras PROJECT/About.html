            <h1>What is <span class="mardi">Mardi</span>-<span class="gras">gras</span>?</h1>
            <p>
                Mardi Gras refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning on or after the Christian feasts of
                the
                Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which is known as Shrove
                Tuesday. Mardi Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating
                rich,
                fatty foods before the ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten season.
            </p>
            <h2>Tradition</h2>
            <p>
                The festival season varies from city to city, as some traditions, such as the one in New Orleans,
                Louisiana,
                consider Mardi Gras to stretch the entire period from Twelfth Night (the last night of Christmas which
                begins Epiphany) to Ash Wednesday. Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the
                Mardi
                Gras. In Mobile, Alabama, Mardi Gras–associated social events begin in November, followed by mystic
                society
                balls on Thanksgiving, then New Year's Eve, followed by parades and balls in January and February,
                celebrating up to midnight before Ash Wednesday. In earlier times, parades were held on New Year's Day.
                Carnival is an important celebration in Anglican and Catholic European nations.
            </p>
            <h3>United states</h3>
            <p>Mardi Gras in the United States is not observed nationally across the country, largely due to the
                country's
                Protestant and Anglo roots. Mardi Gras and Carnival are mostly Catholic holidays, while the United
                States
                has a Protestant majority population (the season is known as Fastelavn in the Evangelical Lutheran
                tradition
                and Shrovetide in the Anglican & Methodist denominations). However, a number of cities and regions in
                the
                U.S. have notable Mardi Gras or Carnival celebrations. Most of these places trace their Mardi Gras
                celebrations to French, Spanish, and other Catholic colonial influences on the settlements over their
                history. The earliest Carnival celebration in North America occurred at a place on the west bank of the
                Mississippi river about 60 miles (96.6 kilometers) downriver from where New Orleans is today; this Mardi
                Gras on the 3 March 1699 and in honor of this holiday, Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville, a 38-year-old
                French Canadian, named the spot Point du Mardi Gras (French: "Mardi Gras Point") near Fort Jackson. The
                earliest organized Carnival celebrations occurred in Mobile, Biloxi, New Orleans, and Pensacola, which
                have
                each developed separate traditions. In addition, modern activities generally vary from city to city
                across
                the U.S. </p>

            <h2>Costumes</h2>
            <p>
                Mardi Gras, as a celebration of life before the more-somber occasion of Ash Wednesday, nearly always
                involves the use of masks and costumes by its participants, and the most popular celebratory colors are
                purple, green, and gold. In New Orleans, for example, these often take the shape of fairies, animals,
                people
                from myths, or various Medieval costumes as well as clowns and Indians (Native Americans). However,
                many costumes today are simply elaborate creations of colored feathers and capes. Unlike Halloween
                costumery, Mardi Gras costumes are not usually associated with such things as zombies, mummies, bats,
                blood,
                and the like, though death may be a theme in some. The Venice tradition has brought golden masks into
                the
                usual round of costumes.

                The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called
                Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.
            </p>

            <p>
                Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
                Carnival clubs, called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade
                goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!"
            </p>

            <p>
                The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid &
                Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes add
                to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all ages.
            </p>
