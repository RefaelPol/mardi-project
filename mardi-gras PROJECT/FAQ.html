                    No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe
                    the
                    claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras
                    website.
                    Using
                    the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not
                    know
                    better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual
                    parade
                    krewe
                    is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official organizations
                    control
                    their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

                    The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras
                    day
                    (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                    Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                    Tuesday
                    is
                    always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                    Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                    Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.

                    What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?

                    The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will
                    change
                    from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a
                    chilly
                    morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                    Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                    somewhat
                    dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely
                    want
                    to
                    bring a raincoat!

                    It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we
                    call
                    it

                    The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the
                    weekend
                    when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New
                    Orleans.
                    The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than
                    a
                    weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus,
                    another
                    big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat
                    Tuesday,
                    walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling
                    experience.

                <p>
                    By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us
                    who
                    grew
                    up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade
                    because
                    we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to
                    hold
                    all of
                    the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.

                    The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                    anyway). We
                    recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since parades can
                    last
                    until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area
                    where
                    you will see many families staking out their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball,
                    and
                    having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop
                    running
                    in this area during Mardi Gras.

                    You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie, which
                    is
                    only
                    10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend,
                    is
                    the
                    parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

                <p>
                    Not unless you are going to be a rider on a float. If you plan to watch the parades during Mardi
                    Gras,
                    you'll catch so much you won't be able to carry it all!
